# Analysis-and-design

For this course we were finding a way to sort data and which method was most effecient. Then using that knowledge we were tasked to
make our own parser and sorter and be able to search through it. For mine I chose a binary search tree due to its scalability in
relation to effeciency with it being more effecient than the other methods with more data.
